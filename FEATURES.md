We wish to have a groovepad, on vovoca itself for people who dont like our music and want to create thier very own. Something like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easybrain.make.music) app. Here you need a grid of buttons which when clicked should play there music unless stopped (by clicking the button again). Every music played as it is, should go to an array and then combine as a single file of music. User should be able to download this file, play it and delete it to make a new one.
