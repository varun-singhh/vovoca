We wish to have a groovepad, on vovoca itself for people who dont like our music and want to create thier very own. Something like [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easybrain.make.music) app. Here you need a grid of buttons which when clicked should play there music unless stopped (by clicking the button again).
