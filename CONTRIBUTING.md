## Steps to contribute

- Raise a new issue [here](https://github.com/varun-singhh/vovoca/issues)
- Wait for the maintainer to reach out and assign the issue to you
- Fork the repo and clone it on your local machine
- Get the issue solved
- Read the complete CONTRIBUTING.md file to make sure you follow similar convention
- Create a new branch and open a new pull request with proper convention
- Wait for the maintainer to review or merge it

## Issues and Pull Requests
- Issue Title should be : `VOVOCA - Issue Number`
- Make sure to add description about issue in the section below the issue to get more clear picture, try adding screenshots/gifs for better clearance
- If you're not sure about adding something, [open an issue](https://github.com/varun-singhh/vovoca/issues/new) to discuss it.
- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as changes are developed.
- Include screenshots and animated gifs of your changes whenever possible.

### Commit Messages

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification to standardize our commit history. To enforce this convention on commit messages and/or pull request titles, we use the [Semantic Pull Requests](https://github.com/probot/semantic-pull-requests) bot.

The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending the type of change being made (e.g., feat, fix, refactor), followed by an imperative, present tense sentence (without a period).
Example: `fix: make header bold`

### Pull Request Title

Same as commit messages, prepend the type of change being made (refactor, fix, chore, feat, etc.)
Example: `docs: add linux setup instructions`

## Styles

Please do follow naming convention for new classes (if added) and try to kee similar to other pre-existing styles

If any of this information confusing, incorrect, or incomplete, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/varun-singhh/vovoca/issues/new)
for help.
